# Algorithms_using_stl 
The repo contains all important algorithms implemented using stl in c++ which are impportant for competitive exams and placements. 

## You can also work on important algorithms not listed in the issue list.

This repository is made taking into account the use of stl and learning of algorithms both at once. All the important algorithms are implemented using stl in the repository for practice. Contributers are invited to help the others learn through different approaches.

Ternary Search is not used widely because search time is same--- O(logn)
